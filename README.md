# imdb-actor-search
Python challenge for job application

Description:
Write a command-line interface (CLI) tool that queries IMDB and allows a user to enter a movie star’s name and prints the list of movies that star has appeared in date order (oldest first) to the screen:

If more than one actor has that name, a menu should be returned allowing for selection of an individual based on available information

The CLI should allow for a reversal of order such that the newest films are first in the results list

The CLI developed as part of step one should have the option of sending the results to a well-structured JSON document
